# Collection of Machine Learning Implementations

## Structure of Project
Each project lies inside its own directory with its name being a brief descriptor of what it does

Inside each project there is a `README.md` containing a full description of the project, including sources of data, outlining the problem, implementation, and other necessary references.
Wherever possible, the folder will contain the data used for the implementation, and if not possible, sources will be written in the directory's `README.md`

## List of Implementations so far
